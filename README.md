# Flicker
## Dungeon Crawler Jam 2023 - Team Grapes

Death has snuffed you out, but fate blessed you with a candle to traverse the dimensions of Prota and Prodo. Navigating limbo, radiance's faint shimmer serves as your last reminder of bygone days. As your precious wax burns away, you must unearth the secrets to limbo and evade the souls ensnared within its halls.
Balance your precious soul wax to flip between the dimensions. Burn one to rejuvenate the other. Be wary, as running out of either wax will leave you stranded...
